# 📊 ANN Classification: Customer Churn Prediction

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for binary classification to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. The model is built using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**, and trained on a structured dataset to classify whether a customer will stay or leave based on various attributes.
